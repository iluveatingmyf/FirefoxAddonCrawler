## Features

- âš¡ Fast crawling with Scrapy framework
- ðŸ“‚ Organized output files for add-on info and URLs
- ðŸ“¥ Automated download script for batch operations

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Scrapy (`pip install scrapy`)
- Python requests library (`pip install requests`)

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Crawl top 100 add-on list
```bash
scrapy crawl firefox_addon_list
```
- Output: recommanded100.txt (contains add-on names, IDs, and basic info)
- The file is created in the project root directory.

### Step 2: Fetch download URLs  
```bash
scrapy crawl firefox_addon_file
```
- Output: recommanded100_url.txt (contains direct .xpi download links)
- The script reads add-on IDs from recommanded100.txt to search for URLs.



### Step 3: Download extensions
```bash
python3 down.py
```

- Requirement: Create an addon/ directory in the project root before running.
- Result: Extensions are saved as .xpi files in the addon/ directory.
- Progress: The script will display download progress for each file.
